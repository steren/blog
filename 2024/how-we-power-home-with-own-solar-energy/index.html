		<p>Our home now almost entirely runs all the time on the solar energy that it produced. Here’s our journey and how you can do it too.</p>

		<p>The recipe fits in two steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong><a href="#solar">Solar</a></strong>: panels and batteries  </li>
			<li><strong><a href="#electrify">Electrify</a></strong>: electric car and heat pumps</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Over the last year, our home was 96% self powered, that includes heating, water heating, clothe drying, and a portion of car charging (we also charge at work).</p>

			<figcaption>Where did the electricity used by our home over the past year come from?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>Our primary goal was to reduce carbon emissions coming from our residential energy consumption. Our secondary goal was to save money in the long run.</p>

		<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
		<p>Here are two charts that should tell you all about the benefits:<br>We installed panels in summer 2023 and got permission to export a month later. We switched to a heat pump water heater in March 2024.<br>Nowadays, we are at ~0 gas usage and only importing from the grid during winter time.</p>

		<h2 id="solar">Solar</h2>
		<p>We happen to live in a place where it&#39;s sunny most days of the year. This means abundant solar power available for everyone to harvest for free.</p>
		<p>We installed a solar system of <strong>16kW solar power and 27kWh of battery storage</strong> (40 panels and 2 Powerwalls).</p>
		<p>Because the sun doesn’t shine at night, batteries were essential to achieve our goal. But even if you only consider the economics, today’s net metering energy contracts (e.g. NEM 3) are designed to incentivise installing batteries. The plus of batteries is also that you won&#39;t notice electrical outages anymore (you&#39;ll be the only house in the neighborhood with lights :)</p>
		<p>We had to size our system taking into consideration the future electrification of our home. We sized it by estimating power and energy: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Peak power production should be able to cover peak power consumption.  </li>
			<li>Yearly energy production should cover yearly energy consumption.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We went with Tesla solar. We recommend them because of their low price and vertical integration. The downside is that you should be ready for minimal customer support and potentially a lot of back and forth in the design phase (it was our case because we wanted to size the system for our future electricity usage and were ready to make modifications to maximize solar production, like cutting one tree). </p>

		<h2 id="electrify">Electrify</h2>
		<p>We switched to an electric vehicle four years ago. What was left was our residential energy use, which was mainly gas.</p>
		<p>The solution to home electrification is in two words: <strong>Heat Pumps</strong>.</p>
		<p>Why Heat pumps? Of course because they run on electricity, but also because they have an efficiency of 300%. Which means that for each unit of energy that they use, they “produce” 3 units of energy. How is this possible? They <em>move</em> heat, instead of <em>generating</em> it.</p>
		
		<p>We progressively replaced all gas appliances with electric heat pumps, by impact order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)</strong>: We started by replacing our gas furnace with an electric heat pump. We went with a 4T and 24 SEER heat pump system from Bryant.  </li>
			
			<li><strong>Water heating</strong>: After switching heating and cooling, we were still measuring meaningful daily gas consumption (1 therm a day), just because of water heating. So we installed a hybrid heat pump water heater (Rheem Proterra 50 gallons). The water heater is most efficient in “energy saver” mode, but takes time to heat in that case. So we automatically switch it to &quot;High demand&quot; starting mid afternoon (when our batteries are full but when we&#39;re still producing a lot from solar) until late evening, to ensure hot water is ready for evening showers. In a sense, our water tank also becomes a battery that we can fill when the sun is shining and use whenever we want.  </li>

			<li><strong>Dryer:</strong> Finally, we replaced our old dryer with a ventless heat pump dryer. It was already electric, so we replaced it to increase efficiency and to &quot;flatten the curve&quot;, as a heat pump dryer uses much less power but lasts a bit longer, it is ideal to match solar production. An bonus is that this removes the need for a dryer vent and its associated maintenance</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="adapt-usage">Adapt usage (optional)</h2>
		<p>If you’ve done the above, the rest can be considered minor optimizations. You can adapt your usage, potentially automatically, in order to maximize power consumption when the electricity is produced by the solar panels and minimize consumption when you run on battery. This means one simple thing: <strong>shift as much as possible when you run on solar</strong>.</p>
		<p>In our case this meant, sorted by impact: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Charge the car when the sun is shining (<a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app/charge-on-solar">automated via Tesla vertical integration</a>)  </li>
		<li>Only run the pool pumps when the sun is shining (<a href="https://labs.steren.fr/2023/pool-on-solar/">automated via custom code</a>)  </li>
		<li>Cool during the day in summer, heat less at night in winter (schedulable)  </li>
		<li>Run the dryer during the day (schedulable)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Anything else, like lighting or small appliances, is insignificant in terms of impact compared to the above (we have automation for outdoor lights).</p>
		<p>How much to adapt your usage is up to you. If you don’t use automation, consider the downsides of micro managing your home for the realized gains. It might not be worth the daily effort. </p>

		<h2 id="orders-of-magnitude">Orders of magnitude</h2>
		<p>Producing the electricity you use is a great way to get a better sense of the power and energy used by things in your home. And it’s all about orders of magnitude:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Your car needs 10x more energy than the rest of your home,  </li>
			<li>Heating air and water is then the biggest factor,  </li>
			<li>Then, your dryer is the only appliance you should worry about.   </li>
			<li>The rest has negligible impact.</li>
		</ol>

		 infographics about energy usage of these things
		
		<p>These are really important to keep in mind because some people are taking on themselves to change their behavior for things that ultimately have very low impact. Don&#39;t bother doing your laundry or dishwasher at the right time, forcing you to turn off your LED lights, or unplugging appliances during the night. Don’t let anyone gaslight you into doing “small gestures for the planet”. These don&#39;t matter if you haven’t optimized the rest first! And in my opinion, their negative impact on your daily life isn’t worth the marginal impact they have on energy usage reduction.</p>
		
		<h2 id="20x-lower-carbon-footprint">20x lower carbon footprint</h2>
		<p>Before electrification and solar installation, in a winter month, our home monthly carbon emissions were 840 kgCO2 / month. Just by switching to electric heat pumps, our emissions would have been 370 kgCO2 / month. So, in California, by switching to electric heat pump heating, you cut your emissions in 2.<br>Of course, in our case, the electricity is not coming from the grid but from our own solar production, which brings down our emissions to 45 kgCO2 / month, a 20x reduction.</p>

		<h2 id="break-even-in-8-years">Break even in 8 years</h2>
		<p>While saving money wasn’t the primary goal, it’s still interesting to see when this investment breaks even.</p>
		<p>This was a big investment:</p>

		<p>For us it was important, but even after the 30% tax credit on solar panels and batteries, or after the local credits on heating and cooling, it’s far more than what most people are able to afford. Of course, we could have invested this money elsewhere and have much bigger returns, but again, making money wasn’t the primary goal. </p>

		<p>Our average monthly electricity bill used to be $632, it’s now $0. On top of that, we make $150 every year from the excess exported electricity and $700 from <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/virtual-power-plant">Tesla virtual power plant</a>. Which means we break even the initial investment in 8 to 9 years.</p>
		
		
		<h2 id="to-recap">To recap</h2>
		<p>After becoming homeowners, it was important for us to make this extra investment. We have now become almost entirely self-powered and almost negated carbon emissions from residential energy use.</p>
		<p>The recipe is simple: electrify your home and harvest electricity from the sun!</p>
