    <p>In a couple of days, my job at <a title="dassault syst&#xE8;mes' website" href="http://www.3ds.com" target="_blank">Dassault Systèmes</a> will come to an end. I finally took the decision to leave the company to entirely focus on personal projects.</p>
    <p>I spent 6 months as an intern doing technological research: I developed a prototype for interactive painting and sculpting on 3D models. I learned a lot from research papers and from my mentor, <a title="Marc Helbling on twitter" href="http://twitter.com/marchelbling" target="_blank">Marc Helbling</a>. I got more familiar with the concepts behind 3D edition software.</p>
    <p>Then I joined the SwYm team as an employee for a year. <a title="SwYm" href="https://swym.3ds.com/" target="_blank">SwYm</a> is social web for companies, it is an online product aiming at changing the one-way relation companies have with their customers and employees. I was doing various front-end work, I lead the Wiki project and was responsible for Search related functionalities (and thus could more recently use <a title="Exalead" href="http://www.exalead.com" target="_blank">Exalead</a> technology). We were working in a very flexible environment comparing to other teams. Technologically speaking, the website used Javascript intensively for its dynamic layout, I learned a lot about this.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t find motivation in my every day work, it’s hard to explain why but mostly because I didn’t share all the decisions. I had too much ideas for other projects in mind. I took the decision to leave the company and come back to a more uncertain life.</p>
    <p>In the next months, I will focus on personal projects: websites, mobile apps, art… one thing at a time (because I suck at multi-tasking). I will blog my updates very regularly at <a title="Steren's labs" href="http://labs.steren.fr/" target="_blank">labs.steren.fr</a> (blog coming soon) and also post results here.</p>
    <p>You will learn more on these projects very soon. I plan to adopt a very open working attitude, and I rely on you, my followers, my readers, to give me advice, feedback, ideas or even to join me. If you are curious, I invite you to subscribe to my <a href="http://bit.ly/SterenLabsNewsletter">newsletter</a> or to connect with me on the Internet.</p>
    <p>If one project goes well, this adventure may lead to the creation of a company. But one thing is certain, for me, being entrepreneur is not having a twitter account and hacking on a website.</p>
