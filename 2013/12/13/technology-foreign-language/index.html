    <p>Two month ago, I moved to Germany, and unfortunately I did not speak a word of German. Here is a set of tools I have been using to be able to find my way in this foreign language:</p>
    <h3>Browsing the web: Chrome</h3>
    <p>Of course, Chrome (desktop and mobile) has a built-in translation feature. When navigating to a German website, an instant translation of the entire website seamlessly replaces the original one. I find the user experience quite good, because seemless.</p>
    <figure>

    <h3>Instant translation in the street: Word Lens</h3>
    <p>You stumble upon a sign in the street, and have no clue about what it is saying. First thing that comes in mind is to open the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&amp;hl=en">Google Translate</a> application on your mobile, it even does not require an internet connection thanks to the offline download of language packages. Unfortunately this would require re-typing the text in the input field (the picture input does not work offline, and has poor results).</p>
    <p>The solution I am using for quick and dirty translations is <a href="http://questvisual.com/">Word Lens</a>. If you never heard of it, it is an augmented reality app that replaces real-world texts by its translation. Here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2OfQdYrHRs">promotional video</a> and a real-life usage example:</p>

    <p>It is a great combination of interesting technologies: real time OCR, translation and image manipulation (to incorporate the final result on the original image). It gives instant result in its more natural way, which is a great user experience. Unfortunately, for its price, I think that its stability and user interface could be improved.</p>
    <p>I’m really looking forward to try this using Google Glass, the great news is that apparently an  <a href="http://blog.questvisual.com/post/67443954608/an-eye-towards-the-future-with-word-lens-theres">app is already available</a>. It will remove the need to pull out the phone and launch the app, however, is will not be full augmented reality as Google Glass is only a Head-up display.</p>
    
    <h3>Translating paper documents: <em>OCR</em></h3>
    <p>The worst is when the data is not available digitally, for example, received official documents. Translating them word by word or manually re-typing them were not options when you receive a 10 page health insurance contracts. Once again, free online Google tools can help with this task:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Scan</strong>: Unfortunately, a scanner is needed to get a PDF file containing black and white images of your document. A simple “portable scanner” can be very handy, but ideally a multi-page scanner is even faster. In my case, I wait the next day to scan them at the office.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OCR</strong>: Drag and drop the scanned PDF to the <a href="http://drive.google.com"><em>Google Drive</em></a> website, make sure to enable the conversion to the Google Docs format on import. This will create a Google Doc document containing images of the scanned pages and the automatically extracted text in its original language.
        <img alt="upload" src="upload.png%3Fw=1024&amp;h=391"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Translate</strong>: The final step is to translate the text, no copy paste needed, Google can translate a full text document to a new one, keeping its layout and style.
        <img alt="translate" src="translate.png%3Fw=1200"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Profit</strong>: You end up with the entire document translated from German to English. Below each original scanned image you find the translated text with a similar formatting. And if like me you prefer to archive digitally your papers, the great side effect is that you have scanned your paper.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Learning: <em>Duolingo</em></h3>
    <p>Of course, nothing will replace to actually <em>know</em> the language. While old-school lessons and grammar books are very often the best strategy, I have to mention <a href="http://www.duolingo.com/">duolingo</a>, a really great application for progressive and regular lessons</p>

    <p>Duolingo is a free mobile and desktop application will help you learn a new language using game mechanisms : your goal is to increase your level, you earn points each time you complete a lesson, you have to unlock current skill packages before going further…</p>
    <p>The learning curve is really well designed so that you are making progress each time you use the app. The fact that it is a mobile application and lessons are short let you use in your daily commute for example. It is very well though to keep you learning  the language across days: You get reminders, you can compare to your friends, using it everyday increase your earned points… And the app itself is so much well designed: its graphics are very nice and user interface is really well tested.</p>
    <p>What’s interesting is that behind the scene, duolingo aims at using crowdsourcing mechanism to provide translations to customers. I  wrote about this mechanism in a previous <a href="2011/02/20/re-captcha-nanojobs-and-gwap/index.html">blog post</a>.</p>
    <p>Don’t worry, I’m not restricting myself to these technological tools  to learn German, but I thought they were worth listing to emphasise how modern technologies can help us in what we would have consider a very difficult environment before. And you, do you have any other technological tip?</p>
    <p>Auf Wiedersehen !</p>
